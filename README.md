# GreatReads
A personal book management app built with **Next.js**.

**GreatReads** allows users to curate personalized book lists, add books from the Google Books API, and connect with other readers. Users can sign up through credentials-based authentication or connect their Google account for simplified registration and login. Book details and reading progress are stored in a MongoDB database for a seamless experience.
